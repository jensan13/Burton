            <h1>About Burton</h1>
                <p>Tim Burton was born on August 25, 1958, Burbank, CA. He is known for his "dark, gothic and quirky fantasy films..." In addition, Tim Burton has worked many times with Johnny Depp and they both have become very close ever since the first movie they made together. In Burton's teenage years, he attended Burbank Highschool; however, he was  not a good student. After high school, Tim went to California Institute of the Arts to study character animation. It is said that Burton was interested in paintings, plays, and films during his young years. Apparently, Tim's pursued dream was a film director. </p>
